After working for about three years with him we finally met [Forrest](http://twitter.com/forresto) on a meet up of [The Grid](http://thegrid.io) team.
During the first days we were preparing a workshop to [MozFest's #ArtOfWeb](http://mozfestartoftheweb.tumblr.com/) track. The idea
was to present a quick introduction to [Flowhub](http://flowhub.io)/[NoFlo](http://noflojs.org) and how to use it to draw with [Mirobot](http://mirobot.io). Then let people create their
own drawings. [Gabi](http://gabithu.me) created a [NoFlo component](http://github.com/noflo/noflo-mirobot) to talk with Mirobot... 

FIXME: write more about the component and show examples. Need to clean up noflo-mirobot first. I think Gabi can help.

The preparation started some weeks before that because we were trying to build a hack to Mirobot, making it
possible to draw on walls. That's a work in progress and we are planning to keep improving and [documenting](http://automata.cc/drawbot) the process.

The meet up with [The Grid](http://thegrid.io) was incredible. We met [Forrest](http://twitter.com/forresto), [Jon Nordby](http://twitter.com/jononor) and [Henri Bergius](http://twitter.com/bergie). [Lionel Landwerlin](http://twitter.com/llandwerlin) joined us
some days later. Those guys never stopped coding and inspiring us.

MozFest was fantastic. We met [Kat](http://twitter.com/codekat), [Eric](http://twitter.com/jenelson), [Paula](http://twitter.com/archiville), [Michelle](http://twitter.com/mishymishyme), [Allison](http://twitter.com/alliself), [Ginger](http://twitter.com/ossington), [Ricardo](http://twitter.com/rlaf) and all the other incredible "art phreaks" of the [#ArtOfWeb](mozfestartoftheweb.tumblr.com) track. [Ben Pirt](http://twitter.com/bjpirt), the Mirobot's creator, joined us in the art gallery and bring us his bots and kindness.

ArtOfWeb was a refuge during the chaotic creative tornado of MozFest. A place to chat, create and relax listening
to [good music](http://soundcloud.com/alahaus/sets/mozfestartgallerymixl2) and enjoining art installations.

Our session did its job. We had people curious about the drawing robot, nice discussions about procedural *vs* flow-based programming and really nice collaborative drawings.

Henri recorded the following video. A really nice way to capture this kind of session.

The festival ended up with a demo party where the most revealing feeling of collaboration and aesthetics experimentation took its
place. Surrounded by curtains, music and projections, people and robots joined again to draw together.

We wish the next workshops be like this last experience and we'll try to make it happens more in the future.

We really want to thank and give a huge hug on all people we met. To our dear colleagues of [The Grid](http://thegrid.io), that made it possible to happen, thank you for all. To [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org), thank you to bring this amazing people together for a better Web of openness and opportunity.

Looking forward to keep *phreaking* art and meet you all again next year!
