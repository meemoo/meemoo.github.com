I'm getting ready to fly to London for Mozilla Festival. I'll be presenting Meemoo at the [Science Fair](http://lanyrd.com/2012/mozilla-festival/sxpxb/) on Friday, [hacking animations](http://lanyrd.com/2012/mozilla-festival/syktr/) on Saturday at 10, and making live animation at [the party](http://lanyrd.com/2012/mozilla-festival/sxpzr/).

## Help!

One thing that I'd really like help with is making an introduction video for the project. It would be similar to a Kickstarter pitch, minus asking for money. If you have a good camera and mic and would be willing to help, please get in touch. It would be about 3 hours, which could be split among a few people, and I'll do the editing after the event. Here are the shots that I would like to gather this weekend:

1. A little bit of talking-head material that I'll script before.
2. Saturday 10am: Documentation of the Saturday workshop, with participants playing with creating and hacking tiny animations.
3. Saturday 8pm: Documentation of the party's live animation (shots similar to [this party documentation](http://youtu.be/T_tCyYGLWKM)).

Woo!
