Now that we have a working [noflo-canvas](http://github.com/noflo/noflo-canvas) it is time to try more complex shapes. [Voronoi Diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) and [Delaunay Triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) are canonical algorithms from [Computational Geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_geometry) and were made classic for generative art or creative coding. These algorithms are useful to create textures or meshes. In general, you can give them a set of points and Voronoi will create cells around your points. Delaunay will draw triangles for each possible triple of points, with non-crossing edges.

The [noflo-geometry](http://github.com/automata/noflo-geometry) implements both Voronoi and Delaunay algorithms. Being NoFlo a general purpose flow-based environment, it is a common approach to search for JS libraries which implements what you want and encapsulate them as a bunch of components. For [noflo-geometry](http://github.com/automata/noflo-geometry) we used libraries by [@ironwallaby](https://github.com/ironwallaby/delaunay) and [@gorhill](https://github.com/gorhill/Javascript-Voronoi), and thanks to NoFlo now you can use both as components with a common interface, at the same environment:

Here are some examples of tessellations generated by the Delaunay component:

[Forrest](http://forresto.com) was invited to the super cool [Assembly](http://www.assembly.org/summer14/demoscene) demo party (!!!) so we are planning to work on components for [threejs](http://threejs.org), [Web Audio API](http://github.com/automata/noflo-webaudio) and [timeline](https://github.com/noflo/noflo-ui/issues/151) to create a demo! Funny times coming, please keep following!
