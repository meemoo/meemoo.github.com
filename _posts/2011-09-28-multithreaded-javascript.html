  When first designing the video remix version of Meemoo, I put the video players in an iframe page, separate from the main application. This made it possible to "pop-out" the players to be shown on a projector. The communication between the app and the players happens with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage"><code>window.postMessage()</code></a>. This is how the new framework works as well: iframes communicating with postMessage.

  blocking module

  At first I thought that this would have the added benefit of running the JavaScript of each module in a separate thread, but it turns out that it only works like this in Opera. I made a test by adding a module with a <a href="https://github.com/meemoo/iframework/blob/gh-pages/examples/blocking.html">blocking script</a>. In all browsers except Opera, pressing the button stops the processing and glitch modules.Â Unfortunately, Opera's JavaScript performance is noticably chunkier than the primary browsers that I'm testing: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

<p>
  I wonder if <code>window.open()</code> windows run in separate threads. This is worth a test.
