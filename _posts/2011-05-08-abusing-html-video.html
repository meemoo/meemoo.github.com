When I set out to write a web application for remixing web video, I did some tests and figured out that I could write it all in html+js, and it has been a great learning experience and mostly smooth. However, there are always going to be differences in browsers. While I haven't needed to write any browser workarounds (thanks to JQuery and ignoring older browsers), the &lt;video&gt; element works differently in the 3 browsers that I'm testing. 
</p>
<p>
The main functionality of Meemoo is setting up and skipping to time-based triggers in video, which is as easy as <code>video.currentTime = 5</code>. Because of the different ways that browsers handle video caching, performance can be quite different.
</p>
<p>
Chrome can skip to triggers around the current playhead with great response time, but skipping backwards more than a few seconds causes a pause. Safari skips forward fine, but skipping backwards causes the video element to report itself not buffered after that time, which blocks skipping forward for a moment. <strong>Firefox with WebM video seems to be the best combination</strong> for now, with very responsive seeks all over the length of the video. 
</p>
<p>
The YouTube player is Flash, and skipping feels a little less responsive than with the HTML video players, but is fast enough. Triggers close to the end of the video sometimes cause the video to rebuffer, which isn't good.

I also had a hair-pulling <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5927573/html5-video-playing-twice-audio-doubled-with-jquery-append">mystery bug</a> that caused ghost players to be playing in the background, found a workaround.
