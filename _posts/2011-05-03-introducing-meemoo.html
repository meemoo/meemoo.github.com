<p>
  Meemoo is a web application that allows experimenting with mixing web video with tools familiar to people who create digital music: patterns and pattern sequencers. Please read about the idea and how to try it yourself at <a href="http://meemoo.org/">meemoo.org</a>.

<p>
  I'm currently <a href="http://rhizome.org/commissions/proposal/2256/">looking for support</a> to create a community site around sharing mixes and promoting remixable video.

  Please get in touch with bugs, suggestions, and exported compositions.
