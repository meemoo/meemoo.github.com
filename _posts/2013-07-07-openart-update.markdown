## Updates

I'm updating [meemooapp.tumblr.com](http://meemooapp.tumblr.com/) more regularly than this blog. You can also see what [Matthias, our Summer of Code](http://matthiassoc.tumblr.com/) contributor is up to.

## Events

I'm excited to be taking part of three events at Eyebeam NYC in the coming weeks:

July 12th - [Open(Art) group exhibition opening](http://www.eyebeam.org/events/openart-â€“-creative-platforms-for-the-open-web). The exhibit will be up until August 10th.

July 13th - [Educator media hacking workshop](http://www.eyebeam.org/events/openart-workshop-day). We'll be talking about potential ways to use hackable web apps in education.

July 15-19th - [Animation workshop for teenagers](http://www.eyebeam.org/events/mozilla-maker-party-moving-storytelling). In this week-long workshop we'll experiment with different kinds of animation with the goal of telling a larger story with small GIF animations.

## Framework

I have been making some big changes in Meemoo, including one issue that has been open almost since the start of the project: nesting graphs inside other graphs. This is called a "macro" or "subgraph" in other environments, and is key to making big graphs more manageable. Here is a [two-minute demo video](http://youtu.be/ylt0SJdAC5Y), and you can try it out on the [beta staging site](http://forresto.github.io/iframework/#gist/5940685).
